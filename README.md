# hbase-to-mongo-export

Selects the latest records from a single hbase table and writes them out in
mongo backup format, i.e. 1 json record per line.

## Requirements

1. JDK 8+
2. Docker
3. docker-compose

## Self signed certificates

The integration tests standup various services as docker containers and the
export and dks containers require keystores and truststores so that they can
communicate over 2-way https. To generate these:

```bash
   make generate-developer-certs
```

## Configuration

* The main class is
  ```app.HBaseToMongoExport```

* The available spring profiles are

  | Profile name           | Production profile | Result
  |------------------------|--------------------|-------
  | `aesCipherService`     | Yes                | Use the actual cipher service that does real encryption and decryption.

## Run locally containerized

### Stand up the hbase container and populate it, and execute sample exporters

Create all:
```
    make up-all
```
Check the logs:
```
    make logs-file-exporter
    make logs-directory-eporter
    make logs-s3-exporter
```
Verify the data in the localstack dummy s3 container:
* Browse to http:localhost:4572

### Run the integration tests against local containerized setup.

```
    make integration-all
```
...this also executes `build-all` and `up-all`.
It is a simple test that the File exporter generated the correct sample set of records.
It does not check that the encryption/decryption is correct

## Run locally in IDE or as a jar (Unix)

* Note this only works properly on Unix hosts with native docker.

### First, you must stand up the hbase container and populate it

This is slightly cumbersome as zookeeper gives the docker network name of the
hbase host which can't be resolved outside of docker, however this can be remedied
if the name given by zookeeper is then entered into the local `/etc/hosts` file.

1. Bring up the hbase container and populate it with test data:

```
   make up-all
```

2. Add hbase and dks-standalone entry in local /etc/hosts file:
See Make targets above for the names this puts in
```
    make add-containers-to-hosts
```

It should now be possible to run code in an IDE against the local instance.

### Running locally in IDE (Unix)

* Only works properly on Unix, not Mac or Windows, as they run docker in VMs.

Run the application from class file `HBaseToMongoExport` and add arguments to the profile:
```
--spring.profiles.active=phoneyCipherService,realHttpClient,httpDataKeyService,realHbaseDataSource,outputToS3,localstackConfiguration,batchRun,strongRng
--hbase.zookeeper.quorum=local-hbase
--data.key.service.url=http://local-dks-insecure:8080
--data.table.name=ucfs-data
--column.family=topic
--topic.name=db.core.addressDeclaration
--encrypt.output=true
--compress.output=true
--output.batch.size.max.bytes=2048
--aws.region=eu-west-1
--s3.bucket=9876543210
--s3.folder=test/businessdata/mongo/ucdata
--s3.service.endpoint=http://localhost:4572
--s3.access.key=DummyKey
--s3.secret.key=DummySecret
```

### Running on the command line (Unix)

You will need to update the active profiles to suit your needs...
```bash
 SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION=./resources/application.properties gradle bootRun
```

#### Console output

Make a run configuration and add arguments as per `hbase-to-mongo-export-file` in the docker-compose file, and update as you need.

...it will then print out what it has exported from the local containerised hbase
