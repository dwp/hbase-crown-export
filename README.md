# hbase-to-mongo-export

Selects the latest records from a single hbase table and writes them out in
mongo backup format, i.e. 1 json record per line.

## Requirements

1. JDK 8+
2. Docker
3. docker-compose

## Self signed certificates

The integration tests standup various services as docker containers and the
export and dks containers require keystores and truststores so that they can
communicate over 2-way https. To generate these:

```bash
   make certificates
```

## Run locally containerized

### Stand up the hbase container and populate it, and execute sample exporters

Create all:
```
    make exports
```

### Run the integration tests against local containerized setup.

```
    make integration-tests
```

## Run locally in IDE or as a jar (Unix)

* Note this only works properly on Unix hosts with native docker.

### First, you must stand up the hbase container and populate it

This is slightly cumbersome as zookeeper gives the docker network name of the
hbase host which can't be resolved outside of docker, however this can be remedied
if the name given by zookeeper is then entered into the local `/etc/hosts` file.

1. Bring up the hbase container and populate it with test data:

```
   make services
```

It should now be possible to run code in an IDE against the local instance.

### Running locally in IDE (Unix)

* Only works properly on Unix, not Mac or Windows, as they run docker in VMs.

Run the class `HBaseToMongoExport` and add the following VM
arguments to the run configuration:

```
-Dlogging.config=resources/logback.xml -Dcorrelation_id=s3-export
```

And the following environment variables:

```sql
SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION=resources/application.properties
```
